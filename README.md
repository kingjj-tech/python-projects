# Point of Sale System

👋 Hi, I’m Ontiretse.

Welcome to the Point of Sale System repository! This project demonstrates a functional point of sale system implemented in Python. It includes features for handling sales transactions, inventory management, and user authentication.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running on your local machine, please follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.6 or higher.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Install the necessary modules:**



   You can manually install the `colorama` module:

   ```bash
   pip install colorama
   ```

### Usage

After installing the necessary modules, you can run the point of sale system by executing the main Python script:

```

### Features

- **Sales Transactions:** Process sales and generate receipts.
- **Inventory Management:** Add, remove, and update inventory items.
- **User Authentication:** Login and logout functionality with role-based access control.

### Code Overview

- **main.py:** This file contains the main logic of the point of sale system, including the user interface and the main loop for user interaction.
- **pos.py:** This file includes the implementation of the `SalesData` and `appTable` classes, which handle the core functionality such as logging in assigning tables, adding orders, and managing sales data.

### Important Notes

- **Login System:** The login credentials are stored in a file named `Login.txt`. Ensure this file is properly set up with the correct username and password combinations.
- 
- **Stock Management:** The `Stock.txt` file should contain the stock details in the format: item_number, item_name, item_price
- **Colorama Module:** The system uses the `colorama` module for colored text output to enhance the user experience. Make sure this module is installed as described in the installation section
